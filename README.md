CPP rewrite of my Java chess program (WIP)

In progress: 
	-Piece movement
	-Move legality
	-King safety and game end detection
	
Planned or Ideal:
	-Javascript web based view
	-Net play using that web view
	-Engine conformity to allow playing Stockfish
		-Algebraic notation, move history, FEN/PGN
	-CPP Model testing (Probably aim to do this before the view stuff)
